#BritTrip

##A project to leverage the limited time you have in a city you don't know.

BritTrip is a react native application built on the ReactNative, Facebook's tool to  allow you to write Javascript and use the React javascript framework to build native iOS applications.

The project was originally created for a hackathon organized by VisitBritain, Yahoo and iGeolise and I rewrote it over one weekend to use react native. See the original version here: https://github.com/tallstreet/BritTrip

To run the app, clone the repo and open it in XCode then click run.
